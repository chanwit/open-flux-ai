What is Flagger?,"Flagger is an open-source project developed at Weaveworks by Stefan Prodan that helps in managing the rollout of new features or updates to applications running on Kubernetes. It provides a progressive delivery mechanism, allowing users to gradually increase the exposure of new versions to end-users while monitoring their performance and stability. Flagger uses metrics and health checks to determine when it's safe to promote a new version to a higher percentage of traffic. This approach helps reduce the risk associated with deploying new features or updates, as it allows for easy rollback in case of issues. Flagger is designed to work with various continuous delivery tools like Argo CD, Jenkins, and Spinnaker. It can also integrate with monitoring systems like Prometheus and Grafana to provide insights into the application's performance during the rollout process.","Flagger is an open-source project developed by Google that helps in managing the rollout of new features or updates to applications running on Kubernetes.

What is Flagger?,"Flagger is an open-source Kubernetes native progression controller that helps you safely and efficiently roll out applications in your cluster by managing canary deployments, A/B testing, blue-green deployment strategies, and more. It monitors application health during the transition to a new version and automatically rolls back if necessary. Flagger is designed for use with GitOps practices and integrates well with tools like Argo CD or Jenkins X. By using Flagger, you can reduce risk in your deployments while maximizing efficiency and control over how applications are rolled out within Kubernetes clusters. It's a powerful tool that helps ensure smooth application updates without disrupting user experience. You can learn more about it at https://fluxcd.io/flagger/.","Flagger is an open-source Kubernetes native progression controller that helps you safely and efficiently roll out applications in your cluster by managing canary deployments, A/B testing, blue-green deployment strategies, and more.

What is Flagger?,"Flagger is a progressive delivery tool that automates the release process for applications running on Kubernetes. It reduces the risk of introducing a new software version in production by gradually shifting traffic to the new version while measuring metrics and running conformance tests. It automates canary deployments by controlling traffic between different versions of a service based on health checks and user defined criteria like percentage of successes for example. Flagger also provides rollback capabilities to revert back to the previous stable version if needed. This tool is designed specifically with progressive delivery in mind, allowing users to safely test new releases before fully deploying them into production. It's part of the Flux project and Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) ecosystem and integrates well with other tools like ArgoCD for continuous deployment or Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring purposes. Flagger is built on top of Kubernetes, so it can be easily integrated into existing infrastructure without requiring significant changes to your setup. Overall, Flagger helps teams deliver software more reliably by providing a robust and flexible framework for progressive delivery in Kubernetes environments.","Flagger is an open-source Kubernetes native progression controller that helps with the process of gradually rolling out and monitoring applications in complex environments, such as those involving multiple clusters or namespaces.

What is Flagger?,"Flagger is an open-source Kubernetes native progression controller that helps with the process of gradually rolling out new versions of applications in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes clusters. It automates canary deployments and provides a set of tools to monitor application health during rollouts while allowing for easy scaling back or forward if needed. Flagger is designed to work seamlessly within existing CI/CD pipelines and integrates with popular monitoring solutions like Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager. It aims to make the process of rolling out new versions more predictable and reliable by providing a set of pre-defined rules for progression based on application health metrics. Flagger was initially developed in 2018 at Weaveworks by Stefan Prodan. In 2020 Flagger became a CNCF project, part of Flux family of GitOps tools.","Flagger is an open-source Kubernetes native progression controller that helps with the process of gradually rolling out new versions of applications in containerized environments, such as Kubernetes clusters.

The primary goal of Flagger is to help users manage their application deployments in a way that minimizes risk while maximizing velocity. It does this through automated canary analysis, which allows for gradual rollouts with traffic shifting based on observed metrics. By using Flagger, developers and operators can confidently introduce new features or updates into production environments without causing disruptions to end-users. The project is hosted at https://github.com/fluxcd/flagger.","Flagger is an open-source project that was initially created by Google, but it's now maintained and contributed to by the Kubernetes community at large.
